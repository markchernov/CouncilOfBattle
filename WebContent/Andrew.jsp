<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>Andrew Conlin was a model in Manhattan before coming to Skill Distillery.  His meteoric
rise shook the fashion world to its core, and was even documented in a documentary called
"Zoolander".  Eventually, it was decided that Andrew was simply too handsome, and that he
was making all the other models look bad.</p>

<p>So, some strings were pulled, a few no-questions-asked type deals went down,
and next thing you know, Andrew had "graduated" from "college" with a "degree" in
"engineering."  Soon thereafter, he found himself at Skill Distillery, owing less to his
Java acumen and more to the unlimited access to hot Manhattan parties that having him
around allows for.</p>
